        Welcome to DISC’s Discover Program Showcase
      </h2>

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Thank you for joining us this evening! The Discover Program connects
        Northwestern student developers with local organizations to build
        industry-grade web applications over the course of two quarters.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Tonight, you will first hear an overview of DISC’s mission and meet our
        leadership team. Next, we have keynote speeches from Joanna Soltys and
        Blake Hu. Following those speeches, our dedicated teams will present the
        projects they’ve built for various community clients. Finally, we’ll
        close with some concluding remarks and discuss next steps for our DISC
        community.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
        We hope you leave tonight feeling inspired by the creativity,
        collaboration, and impact our students have created for local
        nonprofits.
