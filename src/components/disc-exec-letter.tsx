        Dear DISC Community,
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        We’re thrilled to welcome you to the 2025 Discover Program Showcase.
        Over the past two quarters, our teams of student developers have poured
        their hearts and minds into building real-world solutions for local
        nonprofits. From ideation to deployment, every line of code reflects
        hours of collaboration, late-night debugging sessions, and genuine care
        for our clients’ missions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This year’s cohort faced unique challenges—tight timelines, remote
        coordination, and evolving client requirements—but they rose to the
        occasion. Each team member learned not only technical skills (React,
        Node, PostgreSQL, and more) but also how to communicate and colloborate
        across different schedules , manage scope creep, and lean on one another
        when the going got tough.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        As Executive Board members, we’ve watched these projects grow from
        simple specifciation sheets to fully functional applications that will
        continue benefiting our community long after the showcase wraps up. We
        couldn’t be prouder of every participant—for the code they shipped, the
        professionalism they showed, and the compassion they’ve demonstrated.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
        Thank you for joining us. Whether you’re a returning DISC member, a
        family member, or a community partner, we hope you leave inspired by
        what can happen when talented students and deserving organizations
        collaborate.
      </p>
